(snip)
```

Bump version
------------

1. Determine a new version number.  Let it write `$VERSION` as `VERSION=x.y.z`.
2. Checkout `main` branch.
3. Make a branch to release, for example by `git neco dev "$VERSION"`
4. Update `version.go`.
5. Edit `CHANGELOG.md` for the new version ([example][]).
6. Commit the change and push it.

    ```console
    $ git commit -a -m "Bump version to $VERSION"
    $ git neco review
    ```

7. Merge this branch.
8. Checkout `main` branch.
9. Add a git tag, then push it.

    ```console
    $ git tag "v$VERSION"
    $ git push origin "v$VERSION"
    ```

Publish GitHub release page
---------------------------

Once a new tag is pushed to GitHub, [GitHub Actions][] automatically
builds a deb package for the new release, and uploads it to GitHub
releases page.
